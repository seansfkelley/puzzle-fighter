<h1>Puzzle Fighter: Java</h1>
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Puzzle_Fighter_II_Turbo>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo</a> (better known simply as Puzzle Fighter), is a Tetris-esque arcade game from 1996. The gameplay is as follows:<br><br>
There are two players, each with their own zone (left and right). Pairs of blocks (Gems, in this game), which can be any one of four colors, drop from the top of their zone and fall towards the bottom, and just like in Tetris, the objective is to neatly organize the gems.<br><br>
In this game however, you organize them by color and try to make as large groups and chains of a given color as possible: every so often, a Crash Gem comes, and when it comes to rest next to any gems of the same color, it starts off a chain reaction that explodes all connected gems of that same color.<br><br>
The remaining gems drop, and if possible another explosion happens (the cycle repeats). When you explode the gems, a bunch of Counter Gems (the number being relative the number you exploded) falls onto your opponent. These counter gems are not easily destroyed, until 5 turns after they drop, at which point they become normal gems. They do have a color, but can only be blown up if something in their immediate vicinity explodes (regardless of it's color). They can't cause other gems to explode.<br><br>
Lastly, there are Diamonds, which are similar to crash gems, except they will destroy all gems of the color they land <u>on top of</u>, regardless of position or counter gem-state. Diamonds have no associated color.<br><br>
When a player breaks blocks to attack the other player, that other player may break blocks before he is attacked. This is called countering, and can reduce the number of dropped blocks or (if the counter is large enough) stop them completely and instead attack back.<br><br>
A player wins when the other player's next pair of gems is completely blocked from moving.<br>
<h4>How to Play</h4>
Player one (on the left) uses QEASD, player two uses the numpad 7, 9, 4, 5, 6. Left and right (A/D, 4/6) move the pair of blocks left and right one column, down (S, 5) makes the blocks drop faster, and  upleft and upright (Q/E, 7/9) rotate the blocks counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively.<br>
<br>
The game is currently very playable, though there is one rare problem (along with another minor one) and a few unimplemented features. The rare problem is that on occasion, when block are destroyed the remaining blocks will float in midair. They do, however, fall together at the next opportunity to do so, so it isn't a major gameplay concern. The minor problem is that on the first pair of blocks, the next pair isn't displayed in the preview area. The missing features include using CounterGemSet to actually drop a pattern of counter gems (as opposed to the random system now), no score display, and giving the game a start/end menu (as opposed to throwing the players right into the game).<br><br>
<b>To begin the game, simply run OverallInterface.</b> If you're playing on a laptop, run it with any parameters (any kind of input is treated as a request for the laptop control scheme, which uses O, [, L, ;, and " instead of the numpad).

<h1>Classes</h1>

<a name=blinktext><h2>BlinkText</h2>
BlinkText is a simple class that places blinking warning Images on the screen.
<h4>Fields</h4>
<b>private static final int BLINK_DELAY</b>: The time between changing images.<br>
<b>private String type</b>: The current type of image this is displaying. Images types have two forms to alternate between.<br>
<b>private Point location</b>: The location of this object on the screen.<br>
<b>private boolean showing</b>: Whether this BlinkText is being displayed or not.<br>
<b>private Timer t</b>: The timer that turns this text on and off.<br>
<b>private HashMap textImageMap</b>: This HashMap stores all the images used by this class with keys corresponding to their type combined with which form they are (1 and 2 for the two alternate states).<br>
<b>private int which</b>: Which state this BlinkText is currently in.
<h4>Functions</h4>
<b>public BlinkText(Point where)</b>: Creates a new BlinkText at location <i>where</i>. The timer is set to go off every BLINK_DELAY milliseconds.<br>
<b>public void setType(String t)</b>: Sets this BlinkText's type to <i>t</i>.<br>
<b>public void setLocation(Point where)</b>: Sets this BlinkText's location to <i>where</i>. This will not undraw the previous location, and the change will only be seen upon the next expiration.<br>
<b>public void show()</b>: Shows this BlinkText. <i>The text is not drawn right away, it will be drawn on the next timer expiration.</i><br>
<b>public void hide()</b>: Hides this BlinkText. <i>Unlike show(), hide() </i>does<i> hide the text immediately.</i><br>
<b>public boolean getVisibility()</b>: Returns whether this BlinkText is currently blinking or not.<br>
<b>public void handleNotification(Notification n, Object o)</b>: Cycles from one form to the next whenever the timer expires.<br>

<a name=block><h2>Block</h2>
This is the abstract superclass that is subclassed by the four different kinds of gems in the game. Almost all of the functions are already defined, since the gems are almost all identical anyway.
<h4>Fields</h4>
<b>protected int pixelsX, pixelsY</b>: The location of this Block in pixels from the top left corner of the window. <u>Includes</u> the offset from the top left of the Board containing this block. See note below about these fields.<br>
<b>protected Board container</b>: The Board that this particular Block is in.<br>
<b>protected Color blockColor</b>: The Color of this Block (java.awt.Color). Not used for Diamond.<br>
<b>protected Image blockImage</b>: The Image of this Block.
<h4>Functions</h4>
<u>Important note</u>: <i>All</i> functions that involve the pixel location of Blocks (constructors, get functions, move, etc) assume (for input) and return (for output) pixelsX and pixelsY relative to container's offset, though they are stored internally as relative to the window's corner. As a result, the Blocks are drawn (by external functions) relative to the window, but math is performed (by internal functions) relative to the container.<br>
<b>public Block(int PxX, PxY, Color color, Board board)</b>:  Creates a new Block at pixel location (PxX, PxY). Sets the Color and Board variables as well.<br>
<b>public Block(int PxX, PxY, Color color)</b>:  Creates a new Block at pixel location (PxX, PxY). Sets the Color variable.<br>
<b>public int getPixelsX()</b> and <b>public int getPixelsY()</b>: Return the pixelsX and pixelsY fields of this Block, respectively.<br>
<b>public int getRow()</b> and <b>public int getCol()</b>: Convert and return the pixel location of this Block in row and column location. A block is considered in a certain row or column if it's inside by even one pixel, with the lower and right row/columns taking precedence over their upper and left (respectively) counterparts.<br>
<b>public Color getColor()</b>: Returns the Color of this Block. It can be one of four: Red, Green, Blue, or Yellow. Diamonds have no associated color and return White.<br>
<b>public Image getImage()</b>: Returns <i>blockImage</i> for use in drawing this Block.<br>
<b>public Block copy()</b>: Returns a Block with identical fields as this one.<br>
<b>abstract Block copy(Board destination)</b>: Returns a Block with identical fields except in Board <i>destination</i> instead of its <i>container</i>.<br>
<b>abstract Block copyNoBoard()</b>: Returns a copy of this block but with <i>container</i>=null. This is used for copying Blocks off a BlockList, where they have no associated Board.<br>
<b>public abstract toString()</b>: Used when organizing HashMaps. This forces all Blocks to define this for themselves, which is required for this to function correctly.<br>
<b>public void move(int newRow, int newCol)</b> and <b>public void movePixels(int newX, int newY)</b>: Moves the Block into the location (newRow, newCol) of its <i>container</i>, or the pixel location (newX, newY), (argument should  <u>include</u> the offset of its <i>container</i>).<br>
<b>public void shift(int rows, int cols)</b> and <b>public void shiftPixels(int x, int y)</b>: Shifts the Block by <i>rows</i> rows and <i>cols</i> columns, or by <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> pixels.<br>
<b>public void movePixelsNoBoard(int newX, int newY)</b>: For use with OverallInterface function nextPreviewPair, which draws Blocks with no associated Board.<br>
<b>public void setColor(Color newColor)</b>: Sets the Color of this Block to newColor.<br>
<b>public void setBoard(Board b)</b>: Sets this Blocks <i>container</i> to <i>b</i>. For use with copyNoBoard().<br>
<b>public void destroyNeighborsInternal()</b>: Used once a Diamond or CrashGem begins a chain reaction. Destroys itself and calls this same method on all neighbors of the same color as this.<br>
<br>

<a name=blocklist><h2>BlockList</h2>
BlockList is a doubly linked list that keeps track of the BlockPairs that players recieve. One BlockList is used for two players (Boards), because they are to recieve the same BlockPairs in the same order. It manages its own size: at least one of the players' next in line will be the first element, the previous first elements are removed once they have been asked for by both players. The other player will always be at the same or a farther place, and the list will only be as large as the differece between the two.
<h4>Fields</h4>
<b>private Board[] board</b>: A two-element array containing the two players' Boards.<br>
<b>private int gemCounter</b>: Every 25 BlockPairs must contain a Diamond. This counts that.<br>
<b>private BlockNode first, last</b>: The first and last elements in the linked list.
<h4>Functions</h4>
<b>public BlockList(Board one, Board two)</b>: The only contructor requires two boards. It creates the two beginning elements and notifies the Boards that this is the BlockList they will be using. Also sets each Board's <i>otherBoard</i> variable.<br>
<b>public int getGemCounter()</b>: Returns gemCounter, used when instantiating BlockPairs.<br>
<b>public BlockPair getNext(Board requester)</b>: Returns a copy of the next BlockPair in sequence for the calling Board. Calls getFirst() or getLast() to find the correct value according to <i>requester</i>'s <i>listIndex</i> variable.<br>
<b>public BlockPair peekNext()</b>: Returns a copy of the next BlockPair <i>requester</i> is to recieve without changing anything.<br>
<b>private BlockPair getFirst(Board requester)</b>: Called by getNext() if the Board has listIndex==0 (see the class explanation as to why). Returns a copy.<br>

<b>private BlockPair peekFirst(Board requester)</b> and <b>private BlockPair peekLast(Board requester)</b>: Returns a copy of the appropriate element in <i>requester</i> without changing anything.<br>
<b>public void addGemCounter()</b>: Increments gemCounter, called each time a new BlockPair is added. Rolls over to 0 after 24.<br>
<b>private BlockList removeFirst()</b>: Removes and returns the first element in the list. Called by getFirst().<br>
<b>private void addLast(BlockPair b)</b>: Adds <i>b</i> onto the end of this list.<br>
<br>
<a href=#top>Return to top</a><br>

<a name=blocknode><h2>BlockNode</h2>
BlockNode is simply a node that stores a BlockPair for the doubly-linked list BlockList.
<h4>Fields</h4>
<b>private BlockPair value</b>: The BlockPair this BlockNode is holding.<br>
<b>private BlockNode previous, next</b>: The previous and next BlockNodes to this BlockNode.
<h4>Functions</h4>

<h4>Fields</h4>
<b>public static final int CRASH_CHANCE, px, bs</b>: The chance that a newly created Block for this BlockPair will be an Ellipse (crash gem), Board.PIXELS_DOWN, and Board.BLOCK_SIZE, respectively. (The last two for ease-of-use only).<br>

<b>public BlockPair copy(Board dest)</b>: Returns a BlockPair with identical fields except container as <i>dest</i>. <u>Note</u>: This calls copy() of the two Blocks it contains. There no shared objects between the returned object and the calling object (unless container is the same as <i>dest</i>).<br>
<b>public BlockPair copyNoBoard()</b>: Behaves similarly to the Block function of the same name. Also copies <i>pivot</i> and <i>other</i> so no objects are shared.<br>

<b>public void rotate(boolean ccw)</b>: Rotates the pair around the pivot counter clockwise if <i>ccw</i> is true, otherwise clockwise. Calls the shiftPixels() function of both <i>pivot</i> and <i>other</i>.<br>
<br>
<a href=#top>Return to top</a><br>
